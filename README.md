# 🧮 Solana Anchor Counter

A simple on-chain counter dApp built using Solana + Rust + Anchor framework. Demonstrates key principles of Solana smart contract development including:

- 🛠 Account initialization via Anchor's context macros
- 🔁 Counter manipulation (increment, decrement)
- 🧪 Full test suite using Mocha/Chai in TypeScript

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Solana (devnet)
- Rust + Anchor
- TypeScript + Mocha for testing
- Local test validator with `solana-test-validator`

## 🚀 Features

- `initialize`: Initializes a counter account with count = 0
- `increment`: Increases the counter by 1
- `decrement`: Decreases the counter by 1 (error if already 0)

## 🔧 How to Run

```bash
anchor build
anchor test
````

Make sure to install dependencies first:

```bash
npm install
```
